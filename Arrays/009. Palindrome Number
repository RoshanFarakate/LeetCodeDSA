Solution : 
1. First check if the number is < 0; if yes return false;
2. Declare a reverse int = 0, and a copy of number given.
3. reverse is equal to x times 10 plus x divided by 10, and x = x/10 until x>0.
4. Now check if reverse is equal to xcopy. and return it as ans so a the value of return is true; 


class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        if(x<0){
            return false;
        }
        int reverse = 0;
        int xcopy = x;
        while(x>0){
            reverse = (reverse*10)+(x%10);
            x /= 10;
        }
        return reverse == xcopy;
    }
}
